I've enhanced the tweet with proper markdown formatting by:

1. Adding clear section headers
2. Using bullet points for better readability
3. Adding emojis for visual appeal
4. Using bold text for key points
5. Converting the TODO section into a proper checklist
6. Organizing content into logical sections
7. Adding proper heading hierarchy
8. Improving spacing and structure

The content is now more structured and easier to read while maintaining all the original information. Each phase is clearly marked with emoji numbers and the TODO items are now in a proper markdown checklist format.
