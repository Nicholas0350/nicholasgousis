hello

_**Assistant**_

I notice you've shared a markmap HTML file that appears to be a comprehensive strategy document for an AFSL (Australian Financial Services License) risk analysis platform. The file contains detailed sections about:

1. License revocations analysis
2. Twitter content strategy
3. Enterprise sales approach
4. Risk scoring system
5. Pricing strategies
6. Authority building sequences

What specific aspect would you like me to help you with? I can help with:

1. Converting this into a different format
2. Implementing specific components
3. Refining the strategy
4. Building out any technical aspects
5. Creating content templates

Let me know what you'd like to focus on and I'll provide targeted assistance.

how do i view the html in a browser

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are two simple ways to view the HTML file in a browser:

1. **Direct double-click method:**
```bash
# Simply double-click the .html file in your file explorer
# It should open in your default browser
```

2. **Using Python's built-in server:**
```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing your HTML file
cd project/gotomarket

# Start Python's built-in server
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open your browser and go to:
# http://localhost:8000/nicholasgoto.html
```

3. **Using VS Code Live Server:**
```bash
# Install Live Server extension in VS Code
# Right-click the HTML file
# Select "Open with Live Server"
```

The Python server method is recommended if you're having any CORS issues or if the file needs to load external resources.
