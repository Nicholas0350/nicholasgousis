## Centering Recent Insights in Viewport (31/12/2024, 12:41:00)

_**User**_

enhance recent insights so its centre of the viewport 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the RecentInsightsSection to be centered in the viewport. I'll adjust the padding and add flex centering.

---

_****_

```diff
  export function RecentInsightsSection() {
    return (
-     <section className="w-full py-12 md:py-24 lg:py-32 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800">
+     <section className="w-full min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800">
        <div className="container px-4 md:px-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tighter text-center mb-8 md:text-3xl/tight">
```

---

_****_



Key changes made:
- Added `min-h-screen` to make section take full viewport height
- Added `flex items-center justify-center` to center content vertically and horizontally
- Removed fixed padding classes since flex centering handles the spacing

The section will now be perfectly centered in the viewport while maintaining its responsive grid layout.

_**User**_

nice, now enhance it to use the more recent fonts 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll search for the font configuration first to ensure we use the correct fonts.

---

_****_

Read file: lib/fonts.ts

---

_****_



I'll update the RecentInsightsSection to use Space Grotesk for headings while maintaining readability for body text.

---

```diff
  import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"
  import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

Changes made:
- Imported Space Grotesk font
- Applied font to main heading and all card headings
- Kept body text in system font for better readability
- Maintained existing styling while adding font classes

---

_**User**_

now do the same with testimonials 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me search for the testimonials section first.

---

_****_

Read file: components/newsletter/TestimonialsSection.tsx

---

_****_



I'll update the TestimonialsSection with the same viewport centering and font styling we applied to the insights section.

---

_****_

```diff
+ import { spaceGrotesk } from "@/lib/fonts"
+ 
  export function TestimonialsSection() {
    return (

Changes made:
- Added viewport centering with `min-h-screen` and flex
- Added a main heading with Space Grotesk font
- Applied Space Grotesk to testimonial labels

- Maintained the existing responsive grid layout

_**User**_

trying in fix error in @morphing-dialog.tsx by importing @https://21st.dev/serafimcloud/use-click-outside 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error is about the missing `useClickOutside` hook. Let me help you create this hook since the external import isn't working.

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ import { RefObject, useEffect } from 'react';
+ 
+ type Handler = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => void;
+ 
+ function useClickOutside<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement>(
+   ref: RefObject<T>,
+   handler: Handler,
+   mouseEvent: 'mousedown' | 'mouseup' = 'mousedown'
+ ): void {
+   useEffect(() => {
+     const listener = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => {
+       const el = ref?.current;
+       if (!el || el.contains((event?.target as Node) || null)) {
+         return;
+       }
+ 
+       handler(event);
+     };
+ 
+     document.addEventListener(mouseEvent, listener);
+     document.addEventListener('touchstart', listener);
+ 
+     return () => {
+       document.removeEventListener(mouseEvent, listener);
+       document.removeEventListener('touchstart', listener);
+     };
+   }, [ref, handler, mouseEvent]);
+ }
+ 
+ export default useClickOutside;
```

---

_****_



I've created a custom `useClickOutside` hook that:
1. Takes a ref, handler function, and optional mouse event type
2. Handles both mouse and touch events
3. Properly cleans up event listeners
4. Includes TypeScript types

This should resolve the import error in `morphing-dialog.tsx`. The hook is now available at `@/hooks/use-click-outside` and provides the same functionality as the external package you were trying to import.

---

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Property 'children' is missing in type '{}' but required in type 'MorphingDialogProps'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `MorphingDialog` requires children props. Let's update the usage in `PreviousIssuesSection.tsx`:

---

_****_

```diff
  import { articles } from "@/data/newsletter/articles"
  import { spaceGrotesk } from "@/lib/fonts"
- import {MorphingDialog} from "@/components/ui/morphing-dialog"
+ import {MorphingDialog, MorphingDialogTrigger, MorphingDialogContainer, MorphingDialogContent} from "@/components/ui/morphing-dialog"
  
  export function PreviousIssuesSection() {
              PREVIOUS ISSUES OF ASIC COMPLIANCE INSIDER
            </h2>
-           <MorphingDialog />
+           <MorphingDialog>
+             <MorphingDialogTrigger>
+               <div>Click to open</div>
+             </MorphingDialogTrigger>
+             <MorphingDialogContainer>
+               <MorphingDialogContent>
+                 <div>Dialog content here</div>
+               </MorphingDialogContent>
+             </MorphingDialogContainer>
+           </MorphingDialog>
            <div className="grid gap-10 lg:grid-cols-3">
              <div className="lg:col-span-2">
```

---

_****_



Added the required child components and imported them. This resolves the TypeScript error by providing the required `children` prop structure.

I see the issue now. The files might be ignored by .gitignore. Let's check the .gitignore file:

---

_****_

Read file: .gitignore

---

_****_







Let's try to force add these specific files:

---

_****_

```bash

---

_****_







Let's try one more approach - let's check if the files are actually modified:

---

_****_

```bash
git diff components/newsletter/PreviousIssuesSection.tsx | cat
```

```
*[main][~/Sites/nicholasandmidday/nicholasgousis]$ git diff components/new
sletter/PreviousIssuesSection.tsx | cat            git diff components/new
sletter/PreviousIssuesSection.tsx | cat
```

---

_****_







I understand the issue now - it seems the files are already committed in the repository and there are no new changes to commit. The changes we made earlier were already saved and pushed.

To verify this, let's check the git log:

---

_****_

```bash
git log -1 | cat
```

```
*[main][~/Sites/nicholasandmidday/nicholasgousis]$ git log -1 | cat
commit f6843158f035fda30b639c08fd54249fb6a67cfb

    feat: add morphing dialog and click outside hook
*[main][~/Sites/nicholasandmidday/nicholasgousis]$           rbenv:2.7.4
```

---

_****_







Yes, as I suspected - the changes we made to the morphing dialog and click outside hook were already committed and pushed in the previous commit. That's why we're not seeing any new changes to commit.

The current changes in your working directory are related to other files:
1. Configuration files (.cursorrules, .gitignore, package.json, etc.)
2. Project structure changes (renamed and moved markdown files)
3. tsconfig.json modifications

Would you like me to commit these changes, or would you prefer to handle them separately?
