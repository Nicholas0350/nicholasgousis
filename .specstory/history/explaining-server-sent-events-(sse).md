# Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Next.js Explained

SSE is a server push technology that allows a server to send real-time updates to a client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Points
- One-way communication (server → client)
- Uses standard HTTP instead of WebSocket protocol
- Auto-reconnection built into browsers
- Native browser support via `EventSource` API
- Lighter than WebSockets for one-way data flow

### When to Use SSE
- Real-time dashboards
- Live feed updates
- Status updates
- Notifications
- Metrics streaming
- Log tailing

### Advantages
- Simpler than WebSockets
- Automatic reconnection
- Works through firewalls
- Standard HTTP protocol
- Less overhead than polling

### Limitations
- One-way communication only
- Limited browser connections (6 per domain)
- Potential timeout issues with some proxies
- No binary data support

### Common Use Cases in Next.js
1. Analytics streaming
2. Live content updates
3. Progress indicators
4. Real-time notifications
5. Stock/crypto tickers

### Best Practices
- Use event IDs for reconnection state
- Implement retry logic
- Handle connection errors
- Set appropriate cache headers
- Monitor connection state
