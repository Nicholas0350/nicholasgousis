I see there are Upstash dependencies in the project. Let me check if there are any configuration files or implementation code.

do not write any code, what changes happened to afslclaude markdown file relative to @nicholasgoto.html 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the differences between these two files.

The `afslclaude.md` file appears to be a more structured, text-based planning document that contains the same core content as the mindmap in `nicholasgoto.html`, but with some key differences:

1. Format:
   - `afslclaude.md` is a plain markdown file with linear text
   - `nicholasgoto.html` is a visual mindmap representation

2. Additional Content in `afslclaude.md`:
   - Time management suggestions (10-15 minutes at end of coding sessions)
   - More detailed daily content strategy
   - Specific tweet examples and templates
   - More granular pricing breakdowns
   - Detailed sales psychology points
   - Specific ROI calculations
   - More detailed enterprise pitch structure

3. New Elements in `afslclaude.md`:
   - Multiple Revenue Streams section
   - Specific advice about handling CSS and technical issues
   - More detailed "parking lot" strategy for compliance insights
   - More specific guidance on when to queue up content
   - More detailed breakdown of daily tasks

4. Organization:
   - The markdown file is more actionable and implementation-focused
   - The HTML file is more of a hierarchical overview/visualization

The markdown file essentially expands on the mindmap with more actionable details and specific implementation steps, while maintaining the same core strategy and concepts.

_**User**_

do not write any code... why is afslclaude.md file not showing the markdown tags

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the file content more carefully.

Read file: project/gotomarket/afslclaude.md

I see the issue. The markdown file is not properly formatted with markdown syntax. It's currently just plain text with some code blocks. The file needs proper markdown formatting with:

1. Headers using `#`, `##`, `###` etc.
2. Lists using `-` or `*`
3. Code blocks using proper triple backticks
4. Proper line breaks and spacing
5. Proper section organization

Would you like me to help format this file with proper markdown syntax?
