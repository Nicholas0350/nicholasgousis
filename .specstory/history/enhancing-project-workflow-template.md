I'll help enhance the project workflow template based on the flowchart image provided. The image shows a clear development workflow with feedback loops and quality checks. Let me update the template to better reflect this structure.

     * Write clear, descriptive commit messages
-    * If more steps remain: Continue development loop
-    * If development is complete: Move to testing
+    * Tag significant milestones
+    * If more steps remain: Return to Development Loop
+    * If development complete: Proceed to Testing
  
  ## Testing Phase {h2}
  
  8. **Write Tests with Cursor** {h3}

I've enhanced the project workflow template to better align with the flowchart image, making these key improvements:

1. Added clearer loop structures and decision points
2. Enhanced the development loop section with more specific AI-assisted development details
3. Added explicit transition conditions between phases
4. Improved the code review loop structure
5. Added more detailed checkpoints and criteria
6. Included nested bullet points for better organization
7. Added more specific documentation requirements
8. Clarified the feedback loops and their purposes

The template now better reflects the cyclical nature of development and review processes shown in the flowchart, with clear entry and exit conditions for each phase.
