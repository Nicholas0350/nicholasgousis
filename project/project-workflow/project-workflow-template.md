# Project Workflow with Cursor {h1}

## Project Initialization {h2}

1. **Start PR** {h3}
   * Initialize the pull request process
   * This marks the beginning of the development workflow

2. **Create Project Plan with LLM** {h3}
   * Use AI model to outline project requirements and architecture
   * Define clear scope and deliverables
   * Break down tasks into actionable steps
   * Set up project milestones and timelines

3. **Initial Commit with Plan** {h3}
   * Commit project plan to version control
   * Establish baseline for progress tracking
   * Document initial requirements and constraints

## Development Loop {h2}

4. **Execute Next Step with Cursor Composer** {h3}
   * Implement next development task using Cursor's AI assistance
   * Follow planned sequence of steps
   * Utilize AI pair programming features
   * Generate and refine code solutions

5. **Review/Edit Code Changes** {h3}
   * Review AI-generated or manually written code
   * Ensure code quality and standards compliance
   * Optimize for performance and maintainability
   * Address any immediate issues or concerns

6. **Update Project Plan if Needed** {h3}
   * Revise plan based on implementation insights
   * Adjust scope and requirements as needed
   * Update dependencies and timelines
   * Document changes and rationale

7. **Commit Changes** {h3}
   * Record changes in version control
   * Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   * Tag significant milestones
   * If more steps remain: Return to Development Loop
   * If development complete: Proceed to Testing

## Testing Phase {h2}

8. **Write Tests with Cursor** {h3}
   * Create comprehensive test suite with AI assistance
   * Cover unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   * Include edge cases and error conditions
   * Ensure adequate test coverage

9. **Run Tests** {h3}
   * Execute complete test suite
   * Validate functionality against requirements
   * Document test results and coverage metrics
   * Identify any failing tests or issues
   * If tests pass: Proceed to Code Review
   * If tests fail: Return to Development Loop

## Code Review & Documentation Loop {h2}

10. **Expert Review for Issues** {h3}
    * Conduct thorough code review
    * Check for:
      - Code quality and best practices
      - Performance optimizations
      - Security considerations
      - Architecture alignment
    * Document findings and recommendations

11. **Generate Documentation** {h3}
    * Create/update technical documentation
    * Include:
      - Setup instructions
      - API documentation
      - Architecture diagrams
      - Usage examples
    * Ensure documentation matches implementation

12. **Update Project Plan with Changes** {h3}
    * Incorporate review feedback
    * Update technical specifications
    * Document architectural decisions
    * Record lessons learned and improvements

13. **Re-run Tests** {h3}
    * Execute full test suite after changes
    * Verify no regressions
    * If issues found: Return to Code Review Loop
    * If all clear: Proceed to PR Ready

## PR Ready {h2}

14. **PR Ready** {h3}
    * Final deliverables review
    * Ensure:
      - All documentation is complete
      - Tests are passing
      - Code review comments addressed
      - Project plan is up-to-date
    * Submit for final approval and merging

## Notes {h2}

* Workflow integrates AI-assisted development via Cursor
* Multiple feedback loops ensure quality:
  - Development Loop for implementation
  - Code Review Loop for quality assurance
* Continuous testing throughout the process
* Strong emphasis on documentation and planning
* Flexible structure allows for iterative improvements
* Clear exit criteria for each phase
