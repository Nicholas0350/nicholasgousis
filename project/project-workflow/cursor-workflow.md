# Project Workflow with Cursor

## Project Start

1. **Start PR**
   - Initialize the pull request process
   - This marks the beginning of the development workflow

2. **Create Project Plan with LLM**
   - Use an AI model to outline the project plan
   - Define initial scope and requirements
   - Set clear goals and deliverables
   - Break down tasks into manageable steps

3. **Initial Commit with Plan**
   - Commit the project plan to version control
   - Establish a baseline for tracking progress
   - Document initial assumptions and constraints

## Development Loop

4. **Execute Next Step with Cursor Composer**
   - Utilize Cursor's composer functionality
   - Implement the next development task
   - Follow the planned sequence of steps
   - Leverage AI assistance for code generation

5. **Review/Edit Code Changes**
   - Manually review generated or suggested code
   - Make necessary adjustments and improvements
   - Ensure code quality and standards compliance
   - Validate functionality against requirements

6. **Update Project Plan if Needed**
   - Revise project plan based on new insights
   - Adjust scope if requirements change
   - Document any deviations from original plan
   - Update timeline and dependencies

7. **Commit Changes**
   - Record implemented changes in version control
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - If more steps remain: Continue development loop
   - If development is complete: Move to testing

## Testing Phase

8. **Write Tests with Cursor**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Utilize Cursor for test generation
   - Cover both positive and negative scenarios
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

9. **Run Tests**
   - Execute the complete test suite
   - Verify all functionality works as expected
   - Document test results and coverage
   - Identify any failing tests or issues

## Code Review & Documentation

10. **Expert Review for Issues**
    - Conduct thorough code review
    - Identify potential issues and risks
    - Check for performance implications
    - Verify adherence to best practices

11. **Generate Documentation**
    - Create comprehensive documentation
    - Include setup and usage instructions
    - Document any known limitations
    - Provide troubleshooting guidance

12. **Update Project Plan with Changes**
    - Incorporate review feedback
    - Update technical documentation
    - Record any architectural decisions
    - Document lessons learned

13. **Re-run Tests**
    - Execute test suite after changes
    - Verify no regressions introduced
    - If issues found: Return to Code Review loop
    - If all clear: Proceed to PR Ready

## PR Ready

14. **PR Ready**
    - Final review of all deliverables
    - Ensure all documentation is complete
    - Verify all tests are passing
    - Submit for final approval and merging

## Notes

- The workflow integrates AI-assisted development through Cursor
- Each phase has clear entry and exit criteria
- Regular testing and validation throughout the process
- Emphasis on documentation and quality assurance
- Flexible loops allow for iterative improvement
