When you click on the **View Events** button, the same filters you have applied in the Analytics tab are applied to the Events tab as well.

## Date Range Picker

Complimet Analytics comes with a powerful date range picker that allows you to select custom date ranges for your reports.

This is especially useful when you want to compare data over different time periods, or when you want to focus on a specific time frame that is not covered by the preset date ranges.
