## Time allocation:

1. set a strict time limit for solving technical issues before asking for help 30 minutes before reaching out to NextJS/Tailwind communities?

Do not let yak shaving technical details keep you from your core value proposition - your deep understanding of AFSL regulation and compliance patterns.

Search news story about an AFSl facing compliance issues, you could quickly tweet your take on how the right systems could have prevented it.



Morning (30 mins):

1.   Quick scan of ASIC updates
2.   Draft one insight tweet about license conditions [using authority positioning templates](../features/2.content-creation-enrichment/authority-builder.md)
3.   Queue it up (you could use a scheduler if helpful)

Development Time:

1.   When you hit technical blocks using Cursor/working with me
2.   Keep a "parking lot" note for compliance insights that come to mind while coding
3.   Don't let CSS or similar issues eat hours of your day

Evening (15 mins):

1.   Quick check if any major AFSL news broke
2.   Add to your "license conditions vs revocations" content bank for the newsletter

The key is having these fixed short windows for content/market building while protecting your development time.

But when you hit technical issues, get help fast rather than going down rabbit holes.


10-15 minutes at the end of coding sessions to share one insight or learning could help start building visibility while you develop the technical side.
