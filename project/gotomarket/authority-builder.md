Subject: [Company Name] - Critical Risk Pattern Match Detected

[Name],

During my regular analysis of AFSL enforcement patterns, I've identified concerning matches between your current license conditions and three recent enforcement actions.

The pattern match rate is 87% - significantly above the warning threshold.

I'd like to show you the specific patterns privately before they become visible in regulatory monitoring.

Do you have 15 minutes tomorrow?

4.  Authority Positioning:

*   "I monitor patterns across all AFSLs"
*   "My system detected this pattern"
*   "I've seen this sequence before"
*   "Let me show you what happened to similar firms"

5.  Fast Close Language: "Given what I'm seeing in your patterns, I can offer immediate monitoring implementation. However, I'm currently limiting new engagements to ensure premium support.

I have one enterprise slot available this quarter.

Based on your match patterns, I strongly recommend we get monitoring in place while this slot is open."

This positions you as:

1.  The expert who found the pattern
2.  The one with the monitoring system
3.  The person who can prevent enforcement
4.  Someone in high demand

The key is making yourself the irreplaceable expert who found their specific risk.
