## Initial Target Market Selection (First 90 Days):


### Target Profile:
    - Top 20 AFSLs by revenue
    - Multiple complex license conditions
    - Recent responsible manager changes
    - Peer firms had enforcement actions


### Speed Hack: Start with firms where you can find the "worried insider" - usually the:

    *   New Head of Compliance
    *   Recently appointed Responsible Manager
    *   Risk Committee Chair
    *   Board member with compliance oversight

2.  The "Oh Shit" Presentation (2-Week Sprint):

```
Custom Risk Analysis showing:
- Their specific license conditions vs enforced peers
- Management stability score vs industry
- Custom risk patterns from their filings
- "Dark data" they didn't know you could see


### Speed Hack: Find one scary insight specific to them from Firecrawl data. Example: "Did you know 3 of your current license conditions match patterns from \[Competitor\] before their $2M enforcement action?"

3.  Pricing Psychology (Close in 60 Days):


Instead of: "Our platform is $200K/year"
Lead with: "An enforcement action costs $2M+ and 60% of your market cap"

Premium Package:
Base: $200K/year
+ Custom Risk Rules: $50K
+ Board Report Package: $25K
+ Peer Intelligence: $25K
Total: $300K/year


### Speed Hack: "We're limiting custom risk rules to our first 5 enterprise clients because of the custom development required. Two spots left."

4.  Land & Expand Strategy:


Phase 1: Risk Monitoring ($300K)
Phase 2: Add divisions ($100K each)
Phase 3: Add subsidiaries ($75K each)
Phase 4: Global expansion ($150K/region)


5.  The Money Slide:


Cost of Your Platform: $300K/year
Cost of Alternative: $2.1M+ enforcement + 60% market cap loss

Recent Examples:
[Company A]: $2.1M fine + $400M market cap loss
[Company B]: $1.8M fine + $280M market cap loss
[Company C]: $3.2M fine + forced restructure


6.  The Close Formula:

180 Days: Full Integration
Each = Upsell Opportunity


Speed Strategy to $5M:

```

The KEY to Speed: Fear + Scarcity

1.  Show them something scary about their license
2.  Prove others got caught for same thing
3.  Limit access to custom features
4.  Use early clients as pressure on competitors
5.  Make the risk personal to the decision maker



## "Oh Shit" moment using their own Firecrawl data to force an immediate decision
1.  The Setup Email:

```
Subject: [Company Name] License Condition Analysis - Urgent Pattern Detected

"[Name], I'm reaching out because our regulatory pattern analysis has flagged a concerning match between your current license conditions and three recent ASIC enforcement actions. Given your role as [position], I wanted to share this privately first.

Do you have 15 minutes tomorrow? I can show you the specific patterns."
```

2.  The Killer Opening (First 2 Minutes):

Enforcement Pattern Match Dashboard



1.  The Killer Script: "Looking at your license conditions from \[specific date\], we've detected an 87% pattern match with three AFSLs that faced enforcement actions. The concerning part isn't just the match - it's that you have the same sequence of changes that preceded their actions.

\[Show their specific pattern matches\]

These three firms had:

*   Average enforcement cost: $1.9M
*   Share price drop: 42-58%
*   CEO/Board replacement in all cases
*   Personal liability actions against RMs

But here's what's critical - you're still in the prevention window. All three firms had a 4-6 month period where this could have been caught and addressed."

4.  The Urgency Close: "We can implement basic pattern monitoring by next week. However, we're currently supporting only 5 enterprise clients to ensure premium service. We have one slot left in this quarter.

The choice is yours - but given your pattern match score, I'd strongly recommend we get basic monitoring in place while that slot is available.

We can handle all paperwork by tomorrow if you want to secure the slot."

Price: $300K annually But position it as: "Less than 15% of one enforcement action"

### Speed Multipliers:

1.  Have ready:
    *   MSA template

2.  Target AFSLs that had:
    *   Recent RM changes
    *   New compliance heads

3.  Prepare Board Memo template:
    *   Risk pattern analysis
    *   Enforcement cost analysis
    *   Implementation timeline
    *   Sign-off ready

### The 5-minute close: Make the risk personal to the decision maker. Show them exactly how similar entities got enforced, then give them a fast path to prevention.
