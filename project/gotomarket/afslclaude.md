create Twitter content around key levers ASIC uses for regulatory control:
license revocations

 Twitter content could focus on:

*   Pain points in existing compliance processes you've observed
*   Regulatory changes and their operational impacts
*   How technology can automate specific compliance workflows
*   Real compliance scenarios and how they could be better handled with proper tools
*   Industry-specific compliance challenges
*   Cost implications of compliance failures or inefficiencies
*   How proper compliance tech can turn a cost center into a competitive advantage




## license revocations
 are critical intelligence for the compliance community. The paid newsletter about license losses could be a compelling lead magnet and revenue stream, while also positioning you as someone who deeply understands the regulatory enforcement landscape.

For AFSL database, potential tweet themes that could drive interest:

*   Pattern analysis of why licenses get revoked (without naming specific cases yet - save those details for the paid newsletter)

*   Statistics on different types of violations that lead to enforcement

*   Red flags that compliance officers should watch for

*   Commentary on how tech/automation could help prevent common violation types
*   Changes in enforcement focus areas over time

Database gives you unique insight into the "what can go wrong" aspect that keeps compliance officers up at night.



## Twitter content around key levers ASIC uses for regulatory control positions you as the AFSL risk oracle.
- License Conditions
  - Common/unusual license conditions across different financial service types
  - Trends in how ASIC applies conditions to manage specific risks

## Risk Scoring System most compelling risk factors for target customers feature or peer comparison engine.

### how how to derive meaningful risk scores:

    1.  Primary Risk Factors (from your existing data):

```javascript
// Example scoring factors from license conditions
const riskFactors = {
    // Complexity Risk
    numberOfConditions: {
        weight: 0.3,
        score: (count) => {
            if (count > 20) return 1.0;
            if (count > 15) return 0.8;
            if (count > 10) return 0.6;
            if (count > 5) return 0.4;
            return 0.2;
        }
    },

    // Service Type Risk
    serviceTypes: {
        weight: 0.4,
        riskLevels: {
            'Derivatives': 0.9,
            'Foreign Exchange': 0.85,
            'Managed Discretionary Account': 0.8,
            'Margin Lending': 0.75,
            'Retail Client': 0.7,
            'General Advice': 0.4,
            // Add more based on your data
        }
    },

    // Authorization Risk
    authorizedReps: {
        weight: 0.3,
        score: (count) => {
            if (count > 100) return 1.0;
            if (count > 50) return 0.8;
            if (count > 20) return 0.6;
            if (count > 10) return 0.4;
            return 0.2;
        }
    }
}
